# React & Twittering

> Coded along with Brian Holt's awesome [Complete Intro to React v7](https://github.com/btholt). Instead of literally coding along with the course project – a pet adoption app – I built a humble excuse for a frontend that uses a half-baked/WIP Twitter [api](https://github.com/dominicvana/tweet-hacker-server) that I started recently.

## Tools

- React (18)
- Parcel (no create-react-app)
- eslint
- Regular ol' CSS for quick startup
